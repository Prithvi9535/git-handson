Great start 👍 Let’s break down Git basics for DevOps engineers into clear concepts, commands, and real-world use cases so it feels like a structured learning path.

1. Basics (Foundations every DevOps engineer must know)
🔹 Concepts
✅ What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).

Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including history.

✅ Git vs GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

Git → The tool itself (installed on your system).

GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket → Hosting platforms for Git repos, adding features like:

Web UI for viewing code

CI/CD pipelines

Access control, issue tracking

👉 Think of Git as your local car 🚗, and GitHub as the highway 🛣 where you share your journey.

✅ Local repo vs Remote repo

Local Repo: Stored on your computer (.git folder).

Remote Repo: Stored on platforms like GitHub/GitLab.

Sync between them using git push and git pull.

✅ Working directory → Staging area → Commit history

Working directory → Your project files.

Staging area (Index) → A snapshot of what will go into the next commit.

Commit history → Permanent record of changes inside .git.

👉 Workflow:
Edit files → git add → git commit → git push

✅ Tracking vs Untracking files

Tracked files → Git is watching them for changes.

Untracked files → Git ignores them unless you add them.

Use .gitignore file to permanently exclude things like:

*.log (logs)

*.tfstate (Terraform state)

*.pem (secrets/keys)
